# Chapter 1: What Is Software Engineering?

## Key Differences Between Programming and Software Engineering

- **Time:** Engineering projects require consideration of long-term maintenance and adaptability.
- **Scale:** Software engineering addresses organizational scale and efficiency.
- **Trade-offs:** Engineers make complex decisions with high stakes based on time and growth estimates.

## Core Principles

- **Time and Change:** How software needs to adapt over its life span.
- **Scale and Growth:** How an organization evolves with its software.
- **Trade-offs and Costs:** Decision-making based on the principles of time, change, scale, and growth.

## Sustainability in Software Engineering

- **Definition:** A project is sustainable if it can react to valuable changes over its life span.
- **Short-term vs. Long-term:** Short-term projects are mainly programming problems, while long-term projects need rigorous engineering practices.

## Impact of Time on Programming

- **Expected Life Span:** Varies from minutes to decades, affecting the need for adaptability.
- **Dependencies:** Longer life spans increase the likelihood of changes in dependencies.

## Scale in Software Engineering

- **Team Collaboration:** Software engineering involves multiperson development and collaboration.
- **Organizational Efficiency:** Growth impacts efficiency in producing software, version control, and testing strategies.

## Complexity and Decision-Making

- **High-Stakes Decisions:** Software engineers regularly evaluate trade-offs with significant consequences.
- **Sustainability Management:** Focus on managing scaling costs and making informed trade-offs.

## Summary

Software engineering integrates programming over time, requiring rigorous practices to ensure sustainability, efficiency, and adaptability in large-scale projects.
